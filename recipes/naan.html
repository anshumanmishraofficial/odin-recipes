        <li class="units">1 cup warm water</li>
        <li class="units">quater cup white sugar</li>
        <li class="units">3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li class="units">1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li class="units">2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li class="units">4 and half cups bread flour</li>
        <li class="units">quater cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="process">Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li><br/>
        <li class="process">Enjoy!</li>
